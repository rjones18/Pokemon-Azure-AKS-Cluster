# Pokemon-Azure-AKS-Cluster

In this project, I've successfully orchestrated the deployment of Pokemon application onto Azure Kubernetes Service using Helm. Azure Pipelines facilitated the automated deployment of Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IAC) for creating the AKS Cluster. Additionally, I developed a helm chart that simplifies the Kubernetes deployment as well as the Load Balancer Service. To bolster security, the integration of Snyk and Defender for DevOps provides vigilant vulnerability monitoring for my IAC code and ensuring a robust, secure infrastructure for application deployment and management.
